Non-obvious decisions only, grouped by business-logic flow. Anything not listed is left
to the implementer's judgment. Flag conflicts instead of silently deviating. Keep
outdated decisions (no history).

A bullet is a person's pick, and says what it was picked over. What the code does
belongs in the code and its tests, not here; a choice made while implementing is the
implementer's judgment, not a decision. An AI writes a bullet only for a pick a person
already made, and lists it in its pull request; for anything else it proposes and asks.

## The tickets
- Two callers: the command an agent runs, and a dashboard, which reads the tickets through
  the command (`--local`: this machine's copy, no fetch, because it polls and the writer
  there keeps the checkout synced) and lifts a dead agent's claim through `release
  --force` as its module's own pages, found by the package's `openagent.tickets`
  declaration. A dashboard importing the package was the alternative and was not taken:
  the dashboard names no skill. The library a long-lived program called to keep the
  branch checked out and claim tickets for the agents it starts stays in the package;
  nothing calls it now. The executable is `tickets`. The package ships `SKILL.md`, the
  agent's instructions.
- A ticket is a markdown file in `tickets/`. Its plan and its claim sit beside it:
  `<name>.plan.md` and `<name>.lock.md`, `<name>` the filename without `.md`.
- Tickets live on `agent-data`, the branch `@openagt/agent-data` names, never on a code
  branch. The program links `tickets` at the project root to the relative target
  `.branches/agent-data/tickets`, only when nothing of that name sits at the root; the
  target may not exist yet, so the link dangles until the first ticket lands. The link is
  hidden by two rules in `.git/info/exclude`, `/tickets` then `!/tickets/`. `/tickets`
  hides the link, `!/tickets/` re-admits directories, which a symlink is not, so the
  persistent checkout still commits its own `tickets/` under the same repo-wide exclude.
- Closing a ticket deletes it, its plan and its claim, and nothing else; a queue entry
  linking it stays until `queue done`.
- A ticket closes when its pull request merges, never when the work is committed: a
  pull request closed unmerged must leave the ticket. In between the ticket is in review:
  it carries the pull request as a `PR:` line, written by the agent that opened it, which
  then releases its claim; a ticket in review is skipped for work and never queued. The
  close itself is the tracker update's: the pull request's body names the ticket it
  closes (`Closes tickets/<file>`) and the issue (`Closes #<number>`), and the routine
  that syncs the tickets with the tracker closes the tickets of merged pull requests and
  of closed issues. Picked over the agent holding its claim until the merge (a close by
  anyone but the holder is refused), over a workflow on the git host (not every user has
  one) and over a routine of its own (an agent per close).
- A ticket that waits on something outside the work says so in a `Waiting:` line above its
  title, and no agent is handed it or a plan for it until a person removes the line.
  Picked over the agent writing the wait into the ticket's text, which the listing never
  shows, so the ticket was queued again every six hours; and over the agent closing the
  ticket, which is a person's call.
- A ticket's row, the same fields in `list` and `show`: the title from its `# ` line, the
  summary from the first prose line after `## TLDR`, else after the title, scanning past
  headings, `Priority:` lowercased.
- The skill calls the command by its full name and a version range,
  `npx @openagt/skill-tickets@0.1`: the name is ours on npm, so no other package can run
  under it, and nothing is installed in the project. Picked over `npx tickets` with the
  package as a dependency of the project, which ran whatever package holds that name on
  npm where the install was missing, and which a project without Node could not have.

## Flow: a claim
- A claim is a committed file holding one line, `CLAIMED: <who>`, so agents on other
  machines see it.
- One claim per ticket; it never expires: it lifts when the ticket is released or
  closed, otherwise only by a person: `release --force`, from the dashboard or a shell,
  lifts anyone's claim and needs no identity. Without the flag the command lifts only
  its own lock, and closes only when the ticket has no lock or its own, `not-holder`
  otherwise. Releasing an unclaimed ticket is a refusal.
- A lock is written only by a claim; someone else's `claim` is refused while it exists.
  `put` ignores it, so an import can refresh a ticket someone holds.
- A claim the program committed but could not push still counts: the commit already guards
  this machine's readers, and the gap is logged. A write that could not commit claims
  nothing. The program's release is judged the same way: committed counts, pushed or not.
- A claim answers who claimed the ticket before: every holder the lock file's history
  names, newest first, each once, the claimer itself left out. The history keeps a
  released claim, and every agent that works a ticket claims it, so the answer arrives
  when the agent needs it. Picked over the run record naming its ticket (the run starts
  before the agent picks one) and over the agent tagging its own run (it has to remember).
- Claiming a ticket you already hold succeeds and writes nothing, so a re-run does not
  read its own lock as someone else's.
- The holder is never typed: `AGENT_ID` when non-blank, else the current branch. The id
  outlives the branch: a rename mid-session would leave a lock naming a branch nobody
  answers to. A checkout on no branch is refused, never claimed as `HEAD`. The checkout's
  folder name is not read: the layout is the caller's.
- The program says whether a claim is for planning or implementing: a claim for planning
  is skipped, no lock written, when the ticket already has a plan, unless the lock is
  already this holder's; a claim for implementing ignores the plan; only someone else's
  lock stands in its way. The command always claims to implement.
- The lock's existence is the claim: the holder it names decides who may close or release,
  not whether the ticket counts as locked.

## Flow: queueing a ticket
- The package never reads or writes the queue. A ticket is queued by the caller as a
  markdown link to the ticket, the title as its label; the program reads the link back to
  claim the ticket for the agent it starts. The entry takes the ticket's priority; a
  ticket whose `Priority:` is missing or unreadable counts as 5, never 10 or 0: those ends
  (act immediately, only if capacity) are deliberate picks.

## Flow: the command
- Every command names a ticket by its bare filename or its `tickets/<file>` path, so a
  queue entry's link target can be pasted in as is; a sibling's name (`.plan.md`,
  `.lock.md`) is `invalid-path` to every command, `put` taking `.plan.md` and `meta.json`
  the exceptions.
- `meta` reads `meta.json` for its one key, `lastImportedAt`, and `put meta.json` writes
  it: the routine that syncs the tickets with the tracker records its import time that
  way, no program of its own.
- A read fetches origin once and reads everything from that copy: only origin has every
  writer's pushes, this command's own included. With no origin the local branch is read:
  writes are refused there, so nobody else can have moved it.
- Every command that runs prints one JSON document, the result or the refusal. A refusal
  also puts one line on stderr and exits 1. A malformed command line (an unknown flag, the
  wrong argument count) is rejected first: what was wrong and a pointer to `--help` on
  stderr, nothing on stdout, exit 2.
  A file no command may touch refuses with `invalid-path`. Anything a command throws
  refuses with `git-failed`. Outside a repository a command refuses `not-a-repo`; only
  git's own "not a git repository" reads as that.
- `list` answers with a JSON array and `meta` with the bare stamp object (`{}` when none);
  every other result and every refusal is an object with `ok`.
- The command's write is one commit per command, pushed straight to origin when the
  project shares its records, else committed through the machine's checkout. The push
  goes through a throwaway worktree at origin's tip; one that loses a race is re-applied
  on the new tip by `@openagt/agent-data`. The program's writes go through its persistent checkout's
  cycle instead.
- The Overview's Hot tickets card is this package's, reading `list --local` like the page, with
  three lanes: claimed; unclaimed at priority 7 or up, neither in review nor waiting; and
  waiting, at any priority. Picked over the dashboard's own card fed by the tickets provider,
  which also had a lane for queued tickets: that lane was the dashboard knowing both this
  package and the queue's. A row's way onto the queue is the action the queue package offers
  on links, drawn beside the row where a project has it.
- The pages never start, plan or queue a ticket in review or waiting, the rule the skill gives
  an agent: the row says why instead. Waiting has its own lane on the Hot tickets card,
  because only a person removes the line once the wait is over. Picked over a separate
  Waiting card (one more box for a short list) and over no list at all (a waiting ticket is
  forgotten). A ticket in review gets no lane: its open pull request is listed already.
